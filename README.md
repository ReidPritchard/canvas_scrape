# Canvas Scraper
Playwright program for scraping assignments from canvas into todoist

This program was created mainly for personal use, but depending on how much time I have I would love to revisit this project.

*If you don't go to CU change the url in the config.js file*

It's pretty easy to use just use `npm install` and then `node main.js`. You can also use something like Platypus to compile it into a program
